🧠 Smart Resume Parser – Project Report

📌 Introduction
The Smart Resume Parser is a Python-based application designed to extract structured information—such as skills, education, and experience—from resumes in PDF and DOCX formats. It streamlines the resume screening process by converting unstructured text into machine-readable formats.

🧪 Abstract
This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) and document parsing tools to automate resume analysis. By integrating spaCy, PyMuPDF, and docx libraries, the parser identifies key sections and outputs structured data. A Streamlit-based UI enables users to upload resumes, view parsed results, and export them in JSON or CSV formats.

🛠️ Tools Used
- Python: Core programming language
- spaCy: NLP for entity recognition and pattern matching
- PyMuPDF: PDF text extraction
- python-docx: DOCX text extraction
- Streamlit: UI for file upload and result visualization
- Regex: Pattern-based section identification

🔧 Steps Involved in Building the Project
1. Text Extraction 
   - Used PyMuPDF for PDFs and `python-docx` for DOCX files  
   - Extracted raw text from uploaded resumes

2. Text Preprocessing  
   - Removed extra whitespace, symbols, and headers  
   - Normalized text for consistent parsing

3. Information Extraction 
   - Applied spaCy’s NLP pipeline to detect named entities  
   - Used regex to locate sections like “Skills,” “Education,” and “Experience”

4. Data Structuring
   - Organized extracted data into dictionaries  
   - Converted output to JSON and tabular formats

5. UI Development
   - Built a Streamlit interface for uploading resumes  
   - Displayed parsed results in expandable sections

6. Export Functionality  
   - Enabled download of results in CSV and JSON formats  
   - Included sample output files for 5 test resumes

✅ Conclusion
The Smart Resume Parser successfully automates resume analysis using NLP and document parsing techniques. It provides a user-friendly interface for HR professionals and recruiters to extract structured data efficiently. Future enhancements may include multilingual support, keyword-based filtering, and integration with applicant tracking systems (ATS).
